Which design principle is followed by the Android Architecture Components?

Android architecture components are a collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and maintainable apps.

What is the purpose of LiveData?
LiveData is an observable data holder class. Unlike a regular observable, LiveData is lifecycle-aware, meaning it respects the lifecycle of other app components, such as activities, fragments, or services. 
This awareness ensures LiveData only updates app component observers that are in an active lifecycle state.

What is the purpose of a ViewModel?
The ViewModel class is designed to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way. The ViewModel class allows data to survive configuration changes such as screen rotations.
